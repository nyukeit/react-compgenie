                  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license
for software and other kinds of works.  The license is intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a
program, to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it, that you can change the software and share your
changes with others, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL explains that
there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some people write programs for pay, and they can ask the same amount
of money for a program that is free software that they would ask for
proprietary software.  For example, if they write a free program that
can also be sold, they can charge you for the distribution and service
but cannot charge you for the program itself.

  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  To do this, change this General Public
License to the Lesser General Public License instead.

  This is how the GNU General Public License is designed to protect
your freedom, and it is not designed to hold you back from making
software commercially successful.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
kinds of works, such as semiconductors.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
this License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of it,
thus forming a work based on the Program.  A "modified version" of the
Program is a work based on the Program or on another work based on the
Program.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  For a program, it is the source code
that is released in the form of a complete package.

  The "object code" means the compiled and machine-readable form of
the work.

  "You" means the individual or legal entity exercising permissions
granted by this License.  "Your" has a corresponding meaning.

  "Propagation" means that you make a copy of a work and distribute
it to others.

  "Conveying" means any form of propagation that enables others to
make, receive, or propagate a work.

  "Repository" means a storage location from which works can be
accessed.

  1. Source Code.

  You must provide a copy of this License and the source code for the
Program, or make the source code available, for every copy of the
Program you convey to others. You must keep the source code
available for at least three years after you convey the Program, and
you must do so even if you convey it only for a fee.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  You may convey modified versions of the Program under the terms of
this License, provided that you also meet these requirements:

   a) You must make sure the modified version is marked as
   changed, so that its original authors cannot be blamed for
   problems that may have been introduced by others.

   b) You must provide a copy of this License to each recipient of
   the modified version.

   c) You must keep the modified source code available for three
   years after you convey the modified version.

  3. Prohibition of Additional Restrictions.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by
this License.  This means you cannot require users to pay fees or
obtain permission for additional uses, and you cannot impose
requirements that would cause users to lose the freedoms guaranteed
by this License.

  4. Propagation of the License.

  When you convey a copy of the Program, you must ensure that you do
so under the terms of this License.  You must keep this License intact
in all copies of the Program you convey.

  5. Warranty Disclaimer.

  There is no warranty for the Program, and you are not liable for
any defects in it, or for damages arising from its use.

  6. Termination.

  If you violate this License, you lose the right to distribute the
Program unless you are able to comply with this License after the
violation.

  7. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to obtain a
copy of the Program or the right to use it.  However, by
distributing the Program or a modified version, you are indicating your
acceptance of this License.

  8. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  There is no warranty for the Program, and you are not liable for
any defects in it, or for damages arising from its use.

  9. Severability.

  If any part of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
the remaining parts shall remain in effect.

  10. Full Text.

  This License is based on the standard GNU General Public License,
version 3.0, and incorporates additional rights and obligations
that have been established by the Free Software Foundation.
