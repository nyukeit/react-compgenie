# react-component-gen README

This extension generates a React / React-Native component (including the file) based on the name input by the user.

## Features

1. Generate React/React-Native components by providing a file name.
2. Generate components in a specific directory by providing the full path.
3. Creates a '.tsx' component by default but this can be changed to '.jsx'.
4. Detects if the project is React or React Native (base or Expo) to create suitable component code.
5. Automatically detects the presence of 'frontend' folder, to create components inside this folder if it exists.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings
